Project Title: PG County Spending By Agency Fiscal Year 2022

This application was developed with responsive behaviour in mind, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile browsers, as elements of the project will resize and orient themselves on a page in response to screen size.

The API used in this project is provided by PG county, contains data about PG county spending for the fiscal year of 2022, and is linked below

This application drives a bar chart that demonstrates the amount of payments made by PG county during the 2022 fiscal year by agency. (Ex: Police)

This bar chart makes use of the chart js library, which is a javascript library that allows users to make use of a variety of types of charts to display data in a highly readable fashion. 

This application is styled using the latest version of cascading style sheets, CSS 3, with special attention to the use of flexboxes to orient items on the page.

As a whole, this project offers useful insight into PG county spending, and organizes payments by agency. This serves to allow users to see what agencies within PG county are receiving the majority share of funding.
